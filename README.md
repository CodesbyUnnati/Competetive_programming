What is Competitive Programming?

This repostiory contains my solutions to thousands of programming challenges from multiple online judges. The purpose of this repo is to serve as a backup of all my solutions, and at the same time serve as a resource for fellow competitive programmers who are searching the internet for clues or solutions to problems that they are stuck on. I should mention that none of these solutions are written with respect to best Software Engineering practices. The programs are written the way they are so that solutions to problems in competitions can be submitted as fast as possible. In some cases the solutions have small comments describing what the code is doing. This repostiory also features some good implementations for advanced data structures and algorithms like - persistent segment trees, implict treaps, heavy light decomposition, centroid decomposition, suffix automaton etc.

Hackerrank

The Hackerrank directory contains solutions for problems on Hackerrank - a competitive progrmming website. Most of the solutions are of implementation problems as of now.

Codechef

solutions to problems from the onlie competitive coding platform codechef. The reposotory contains my solutions to various implementation problems ranging across many difficulty levels.
